description: Core operations and actions for agent execution
---

## Overview

Operations (ops) define the core actions that agents can perform. This module provides the fundamental building blocks for agent behavior and task execution.

## Features

- **Operation Definitions**: Define standard operations for agents
- **Operation Execution**: Execute operations with proper context
- **Operation Chaining**: Chain multiple operations together
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for operation failures

## Usage

Operations are the atomic units of work that agents perform. They can be combined to create complex workflows and task sequences.

## Integration

Operations integrate with:
- **Executor**: Executes operations as part of agent tasks
- **Planner**: Breaks down objectives into operations
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates operation execution across agents
