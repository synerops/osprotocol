title: Data
description: State infrastructure with durable storage and temporary cache capabilities

import { Database, HardDrive, Zap } from 'lucide-react';

## Overview

The Data domain provides state infrastructure for the Agentic OS. It contains two first-class capabilities that serve as sibling abstractions for managing application state:

- **Storage** — durable, authoritative source of truth
- **Cache** — temporary, evictable optimization layer

Data is **not part of the agent loop**. It is the substrate over which cognition operates. Agents access data indirectly through actions, keeping the cognitive loop clean: `context → action → verification`.

## Design Principle

> Do not model properties as modules. Model executable capabilities.

Traditional operating systems don't expose "persistence" as a module. They expose a filesystem (storage) and a page/buffer cache (cache). The Data domain follows the same principle — it models **how state is accessed** and **how state is optimized**, not where data lives.

## Data Capabilities

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<HardDrive />} href="/docs/system/data/storage" title="Storage">
    Durable source of truth with optimistic concurrency. No automatic expiration.
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<Zap />} href="/docs/system/data/cache" title="Cache">
    Temporary optimization layer with TTL, HTTP caching semantics, and pattern-based invalidation.

## How Data Relates to the Agent Loop

The agent loop remains `context → action → verification`. Data is accessed indirectly through actions:

```typescript
// The agent doesn't think about cache — it requests an action
action: get_repository_file

// The implementation (hidden from the agent):
// 1. Check data.cache
// 2. On miss → fetch from external API
// 3. Store in cache
// 4. Return result
```

For advanced use cases, agents can interact with data explicitly:

```typescript
// Conscious cache invalidation on a webhook event
await data.cache.invalidate(`github:${repoId}:*`)

// Inter-agent state sharing via storage
await data.storage.put('user:123:preferences', prefs)
```

## The Data Interface

```typescript
interface Data {
  storage: Storage  // Durable source of truth
  cache: Cache      // Temporary optimization layer
}
```

## Integration with Other Layers

Data integrates with:

- **[System](/docs/system)**: Data lives under system as infrastructure
- **[Actions](/docs/actions/tools)**: Actions read/write data on behalf of agents
- **[Context](/docs/context)**: Context may be backed by storage internally
- **[Checks](/docs/checks/audit)**: Audit logs may use storage for durability

## Next Steps

- Explore **[Storage](/docs/system/data/storage)** for durable state management
- Explore **[Cache](/docs/system/data/cache)** for optimized data access
- Review the **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)** to see how data fits in the system
