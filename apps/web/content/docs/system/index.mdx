## Overview

The System Intelligence layer provides infrastructure services that all agents depend on. Unlike traditional protocols that focus solely on agent-to-agent communication, OSP includes system-level intelligence through the Operating System abstraction.

This layer manages the lifecycle, coordination, and resource management that multi-agent systems require, providing the foundation for reliable, scalable agent orchestration.

## The Operating System Abstraction

Just as traditional operating systems abstract hardware resources (CPU, memory, disk), the System Intelligence layer abstracts cognitive resources (inference, context, knowledge, tools). It provides standardized APIs for:

- **Agent Registry**: Discovery and capability management
- **System Configuration**: Environment and settings management
- **File Operations**: Standardized file system interfaces
- **Protocol Integration**: MCP client and external tool access
- **Installation & Setup**: System deployment and configuration

## How System Intelligence Works

The System Intelligence layer operates at the infrastructure level, providing services that agents use rather than defining agent behavior directly:

1. **Registration**: Agents register capabilities with the Registry
2. **Discovery**: The OS matches agents to tasks based on capabilities
3. **Configuration**: Environment and settings provide runtime context
4. **Execution**: Filesystem and MCP enable tool access and file operations
5. **Management**: Installer and preferences configure the system

These components work together to provide the resource abstraction, process isolation, and inter-process communication that define an Agentic OS.

## Integration with Other Layers

System Intelligence integrates with:

- **[Skills Framework](/docs/skills/orchestrator)**: Orchestrators use Registry for agent discovery
- **[Context Management](/docs/context)**: Filesystem and Environment provide context storage
- **[Quality Assurance](/docs/checks/audit)**: Settings and Preferences configure audit behavior
- **[Actions](/docs/actions/tools)**: MCP Client enables standardized tool access

## Next Steps

- Explore **[Registry](/docs/system/registry)** to understand agent discovery and matching
- Learn about **[Environment](/docs/system/env)** for configuration management
- Review **[MCP Client](/docs/system/mcp-client)** for external protocol integration
- Understand how System Intelligence fits into the **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)**
