description: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
---

## Overview

The fallback module provides error handling and recovery mechanisms for agent operations. It ensures system resilience and graceful degradation when errors occur.

## Features

- **Error Detection**: Detect errors and failures
- **Recovery Strategies**: Implement recovery strategies
- **Fallback Actions**: Define fallback actions for failures
- **Error Reporting**: Report errors for analysis and improvement

## Usage

Fallback mechanisms ensure system reliability by handling errors gracefully and providing alternative execution paths when primary methods fail.

## Integration

Fallback integrates with:
- **Executor**: Handles execution errors
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates recovery across agents
- **Retries**: Works with retry mechanisms
