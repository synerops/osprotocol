## What is the Agentic OS Protocol?

The Agentic OS Protocol (OSP) is a specification—a shared contract that defines the interfaces, behaviors, and data formats for orchestrating AI agents at scale.

Think of it as the blueprint you implement: it tells you which modules exist (Skills, System, Context, Checks, Actions, Runs, Workflows), how they interact, and what “conformant” behavior looks like. It’s not a runtime or framework—you build to it.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://osprotocol.dev/v1/schema.json"
}
```

## Getting Started

OSP defines the contract for building agent systems that can work together seamlessly, with standardized patterns for coordination, quality assurance, and context management. Below are the key entry points to understand and implement the protocol.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modularity
The protocol is built from modular components that can be combined to create custom agent systems. Each component has a specific responsibility and can work independently or in combination with others.

### 2. Standardization
By providing standardized patterns and interfaces, the protocol enables interoperability between different agent implementations and systems.

### 3. Quality First
Quality assurance is built into the protocol, with mechanisms for monitoring, auditing, and ensuring agent behavior meets defined standards.

### 4. Scalability
The architecture is designed to scale from simple single-agent systems to complex distributed multi-agent environments.

## Key Components

The protocol is organized into several key areas:

- **Skills**: Core agent capabilities (Orchestrator, Planner, Executor)
- **System**: System-level intelligence (Registry, Environment, Settings)
- **Context**: Context management (Memory, Documents, Embeddings)
- **Checks**: Quality assurance (Audit, Judge, Rules)
- **Actions**: Agent actions and operations
- **Runs**: Execution management (Retries, Timeouts, Human-in-the-Loop)
- **Workflows**: Workflow orchestration and optimization
