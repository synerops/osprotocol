## What is the Agentic OS Protocol?

The Agentic OS Protocol (OSP) is a specification—a shared contract that defines the interfaces, behaviors, and data formats for orchestrating AI agents at scale.

Think of it as the blueprint you implement: it tells you which modules exist (Skills, System, Context, Checks, Actions, Runs, Workflows), how they interact, and what “conformant” behavior looks like. It’s not a runtime or framework—you build to it.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://osprotocol.dev/v1/schema.json"
}
```

## Getting Started

OSP defines the contract for building agent systems that can work together seamlessly, with standardized patterns for coordination, quality assurance, and context management. Below are the key entry points to understand and implement the protocol.
