## Overview

The retries module provides retry mechanisms for failed operations. It enables automatic retry of failed tasks with configurable strategies and backoff policies.

## Features

- **Retry Strategies**: Define retry strategies (exponential backoff, linear, etc.)
- **Retry Limits**: Set maximum retry attempts
- **Error Classification**: Classify errors to determine retry eligibility
- **Retry Tracking**: Track retry attempts and outcomes

## Usage

Retries improve system reliability by automatically retrying failed operations, handling transient errors and network issues.

## Integration

Retries integrate with:
- **Executor**: Retries failed task executions
- **Fallback**: Works with fallback mechanisms
- **Timeout**: Respects timeout constraints
