title: Conformance
description: Understanding OSP implementation requirements
---

## Overview

Conformance defines what it means to implement the Agentic OS Protocol. The specification uses precise language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY) to distinguish between absolute requirements, strong recommendations, and optional features.

## Implementation Conformance

An implementation conforms to this specification if it:

1. **Implements all MUST-level requirements**
   - Core execution pattern ([Agent Loop](/docs/concepts/agent-loop))
   - Registration and discovery interfaces
   - Essential tool and action interfaces
   - Required quality assurance mechanisms

2. **Follows all specified interfaces and contracts**
   - Tool interfaces and schemas
   - Context management contracts
   - Error handling protocols
   - MCP integration standards

3. **Adheres to defined data formats and schemas**
   - Registration data structures
   - Tool parameter schemas
   - Context isolation boundaries
   - Result formats

4. **Supports required workflow patterns**
   - System/Control workflows ([Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle))
   - Essential recovery mechanisms
   - Error handling workflows

## Partial Conformance

Implementations MAY implement subsets of this specification, but MUST clearly document:

- **Which components are implemented**
  Example: "Implements Skills and System Intelligence, but not Vector embeddings"

- **Which components are not implemented**
  Example: "Does not support Visual Feedback or LLM-as-Judge workflows"

- **Any deviations from the specification**
  Example: "Uses alternative authentication mechanism instead of specified protocol"

Partial conformance enables incremental adoption while maintaining transparency about capabilities.

## Normative vs Informative

Understanding the distinction is crucial for implementers:

### Normative Sections

Define requirements that MUST be followed for conformance:
- Interface specifications
- Required behaviors
- Data format definitions
- MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements

### Informative Sections

Provide guidance, examples, and context (marked as "non-normative" or "informative"):
- Implementation examples
- Best practices
- Rationale explanations
- Historical context

## Security Considerations

While the specification does not define specific security mechanisms, implementations SHOULD:

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Secure communication channels
- Validate all inputs
- Implement audit logging
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Testing Conformance

Implementations should verify conformance by:

1. **Interface compliance**: All required interfaces are implemented correctly
2. **Behavior verification**: Components behave according to specifications
3. **Integration testing**: Workflows execute as specified
4. **Quality checks**: Quality assurance mechanisms function properly
