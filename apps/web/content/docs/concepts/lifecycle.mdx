title: Agent Lifecycle
description: System-level agent management workflow
---

## Overview

The Agent Lifecycle is a System/Control Workflow that defines how agents are managed within the system. Unlike the [Agent Loop](/docs/concepts/agent-loop) (which describes internal execution), the Lifecycle governs system-level responsibilities: registration, discovery, execution management, and evaluation.

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Registration│───▶│  Discovery  │───▶│  Execution  │───▶│  Evaluation │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

## The Four Phases

### 1. Registration

Agents declare their capabilities and constraints to the system:
- Capability declaration
- Resource requirements specification
- Constraint definition
- Metadata registration

Learn more: [System Registry](/docs/system/registry)

### 2. Discovery

The system exposes agents for selection and routing:
- Capability-based discovery
- Dynamic service discovery
- Load balancing mechanisms
- Failover protocols

Learn more: [System Registry](/docs/system/registry)

### 3. Execution Management

The OS assigns tasks and monitors progress:
- Task assignment interfaces
- Real-time monitoring
- Error handling
- State management
- Policy enforcement

### 4. Evaluation

Outputs, logs, and performance are reviewed:
- Performance monitoring
- Quality assessment
- Compliance verification
- Adaptation mechanisms

## Lifecycle vs Loop vs Workflows

Understanding the distinction is crucial:

| Concept | Layer | Purpose | Scope |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Lifecycle** | System | Agent management | OS/Platform governance |
| **[Loop](/docs/concepts/agent-loop)** | Cognitive | Internal execution | Single agent reasoning |
| **[Workflows](/docs/concepts/workflows-taxonomy)** | Operational | Task orchestration | Multi-step processes |

- **Lifecycle** exists *outside* any specific workflow—it's the system contract
- **Loop** executes *inside* workflows—it's the cognitive engine
- **Workflows** orchestrate *during* Execution/Evaluation phases—they're the macro patterns
