## What is a Protocol Specification?

The Agentic OS Protocol (OSP) is a **specification**, not an implementation. Like HTTP (RFC 7230-7235), JSON (RFC 8259), or the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it defines:

- **Interfaces**: How components communicate and interact
- **Behaviors**: Expected behaviors and state transitions
- **Data Formats**: Structure, validation rules, and schemas
- **Requirements**: What implementations must support
- **Contracts**: Agreements between components and agents

Implementations can be built in any language or technology stack, as long as they adhere to the defined interfaces and behaviors.

## RFC 2119 Terminology

This specification uses precise language to indicate requirement levels:

- **MUST** / **REQUIRED**: Absolute requirement
- **MUST NOT**: Absolute prohibition
- **SHOULD** / **RECOMMENDED**: Strong recommendation (may be valid reasons to ignore in particular circumstances)
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL**: Truly optional

Reference: [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)

## How to Read This Spec

1. Start with **Concepts** (this section) to understand core mental models
2. Review **[Architecture](/docs/architecture)** for system-level design
3. Explore specific modules: **[Operating System](/docs/system/registry)**, **[Skills](/docs/skills/orchestrator)**, **[Workflows](/docs/workflows/routing)**
4. Refer to the complete specification in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/synerops/osprotocol/blob/main/AGENTS.md)

## Next Steps

- Understand the **[Agent Loop](/docs/concepts/agent-loop)** - the core execution pattern
- Learn about the **[Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle)** - system-level agent management
- Explore **[Workflow Taxonomy](/docs/concepts/workflows-taxonomy)** - operational patterns
