description: Parallel task execution and workflow parallelization
---

## Overview

The parallelization module enables parallel task execution and workflow parallelization. It manages concurrent execution of independent tasks, improving overall system throughput.

## Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Execute tasks in parallel
- **Dependency Management**: Manage task dependencies for parallel execution
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize resource usage for parallel tasks
- **Concurrency Control**: Control concurrency levels

## Usage

Parallelization improves system performance by executing independent tasks concurrently, reducing overall execution time and improving resource utilization.

## Integration

Parallelization integrates with:
- **Orchestrator**: Enables parallel orchestration
- **Executor**: Executes tasks in parallel
- **Routing**: Routes tasks for parallel execution

## Workflow Orchestration

Parallelization is a key component of workflow orchestration, enabling efficient execution of complex workflows with multiple independent tasks.
