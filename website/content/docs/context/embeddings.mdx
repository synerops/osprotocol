title: Embeddings
description: Vector embeddings generation and management
---

## Overview

The embeddings module generates and manages vector embeddings for semantic search and similarity matching. It enables agents to work with high-dimensional vector representations of data.

## Features

- **Embedding Generation**: Generate embeddings for text and data
- **Embedding Storage**: Store embeddings efficiently
- **Similarity Search**: Perform similarity searches using embeddings
- **Embedding Management**: Manage embedding models and versions

## Usage

Embeddings enable semantic search and similarity matching, allowing agents to find relevant information based on meaning rather than exact matches.

## Integration

Embeddings integrate with:
- **Vector**: Store embeddings in vector databases
- **Documents**: Generate embeddings for documents
- **Memory**: Use embeddings for semantic memory retrieval
