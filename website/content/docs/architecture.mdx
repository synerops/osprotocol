description: High-level architecture of the Agentic OS Protocol
---

## Overview

The Agentic OS Protocol is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns and enables flexible composition of agent systems.

## Core Layers

### 1. Skills Framework
The foundation of agent capabilities, providing three core skills:

- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple agents and manages task distribution
- **Planner**: Breaks down complex objectives into actionable tasks
- **Executor**: Handles the actual execution of agent tasks

### 2. System Intelligence
System-level components that provide infrastructure:

- **Registry**: Manages agent registration and discovery
- **Environment**: Handles configuration and environment management
- **Filesystem**: Provides file system operations
- **Settings**: Manages preferences and configurations

### 3. Context Management
Components for managing and persisting context:

- **Memory**: Persistent memory and knowledge storage
- **Documents**: Document processing and management
- **Embeddings**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Persistence**: Data persistence and retrieval

### 4. Quality Assurance
Built-in mechanisms for ensuring quality:

- **Audit**: Monitors agent behavior and compliance
- **Judge**: Evaluates agent performance and output quality
- **Rules**: Defines behavioral constraints and guidelines
- **Fallback**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Agent Lifecycle

Agents in the protocol follow a clear lifecycle:

1. **Registration**: Agents register with the system registry
2. **Discovery**: Agents are discovered based on task requirements
3. **Execution**: Tasks are assigned and executed
4. **Evaluation**: Performance is monitored and assessed

## Integration Patterns

The protocol supports several integration patterns:

- **MCP Integration**: Standardized communication via Model Context Protocol
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Parallel execution with dependency management
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Human oversight and intervention mechanisms

## Design Philosophy

The architecture prioritizes:

- **Modularity**: Components can be used independently or together
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new components and capabilities
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and auditing capabilities
