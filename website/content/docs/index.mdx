## What is the Agentic OS Protocol?

The Agentic OS Protocol (OSP) is a comprehensive framework designed to orchestrate, manage, and execute AI agents in distributed, scalable environments. It provides the infrastructure and patterns needed to build robust, multi-agent systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modularity
The protocol is built from modular components that can be combined to create custom agent systems. Each component has a specific responsibility and can work independently or in combination with others.

### 2. Standardization
By providing standardized patterns and interfaces, the protocol enables interoperability between different agent implementations and systems.

### 3. Quality First
Quality assurance is built into the protocol, with mechanisms for monitoring, auditing, and ensuring agent behavior meets defined standards.

### 4. Scalability
The architecture is designed to scale from simple single-agent systems to complex distributed multi-agent environments.

## Key Components

The protocol is organized into several key areas:

- **Skills**: Core agent capabilities (Orchestrator, Planner, Executor)
- **System**: System-level intelligence (Registry, Environment, Settings)
- **Context**: Context management (Memory, Documents, Embeddings)
- **Checks**: Quality assurance (Audit, Judge, Rules)
- **Actions**: Agent actions and operations
- **Runs**: Execution management (Retries, Timeouts, Human-in-the-Loop)
- **Workflows**: Workflow orchestration and optimization
